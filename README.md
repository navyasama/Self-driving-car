# Self Driving Car ðŸ›£ðŸš—

An advanced computer vision-based Self-Driving Car project using deep learning and object detection techniques including YOLOv9 and R-CNN.

##  Key Highlights

-  **Modeling & Detection**: Achieved **95% object detection accuracy** using **YOLOv9** and improved detection performance by **18%** with **R-CNN**.
-  **Data Strategy**: Analyzed over **21,000+ images** with **Pandas**, resolved class imbalances, and improved augmentation strategies.
-  **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Built using **OpenCV** and **Pillow**, boosting model accuracy to **86.2%** with a validation loss of **0.64**.
-  **Synthetic Augmentation**: Enhanced data quality by **20%** using **Self-Attention GAN (SAGAN)**.
